# Project_delays

The two major issues facing the software industry currently are delayed projects and budget overruns. As part of this paper, I have tried to address the causes of project delays. There have been papers over the years discussing this particular issue but I did not find any recent papers on project delays. This led me to design my own survey and do a comparison study of the results with older papers. The conclusions that can be derived from this research is that improper planning and estimation is one of the main root causes of project delays in the software development industry. Most of the developers tend to think that project delays usually occur due to inefficient management whereas the management people are of the opinion that the delays are caused due to inefficient team members. The study has responses from various people currently working in the software development industry. Also the correlation of this with the past tells us that the problems have not really changed. Poor planning was an issue back in the 90s as well as now. This study can be further extended using machine learning models once enough data is collected.
